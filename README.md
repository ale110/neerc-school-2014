These are my solutions for the [regional olympiad in programming][neerc-school]. Feel free to observe those. There are lots of errors, though.

## Day 1

I have only programs I've managed to save from the [web panel][pcms2] (the first three ones). I have ZIP that contains the fourth one, but it is sort of broken (yeah, I should have base64'd it). If anybody willing to decipher it, [go give it a try][zip]. If you succeed, please [email me][email].
